# Lisp parser
An exercise built for Recurse center's application process

## Objectives:
- Understanding the different parts of parsing a language
- Building a parser from scratch
- Making most basic features of Common Lisp available

### Building Diary
*The building process behind the lexer and tokenizer hasn't been documented*

**07/10/2022**
I spent most of the time reading the guide and trying to understand the main logic that stands behind the parsing part.
As for the lexer and tokenizer, the process seems simple, but translating the process into machine code seems to be quite a challenge, at least for the first time.

**08/10/2022**
Today I was able to build half of the parser.
I feel as if my understanding of recursive functions is getting stronger; I'm also very happy about how I was able to bend the guide to my needs, modifiying the examples to accomodate for Lisp's syntax.
